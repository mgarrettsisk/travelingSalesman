Problem 1 GUI Elements:

Canvas where squares and numbers are drawn
Text Area showing steps to completion

Start temperature input
End temperature input
Temperature Decrement
Iterations per decrement

Generate random arrangement button
Solve puzzle button



Design outline:

Current state -> examine each possible move (this is the iteration number)
	The heuristic used is total number of places each number is away from its intended position
	IF move doesn't reduce the value
	IF no choice minimizes the value THEN
		IF random number between 0 and 1 is greater than e^-Delta/T
			Then reject the bad move
		ELSE
			Accept the bad move
	THEN
		Accept all good moves

Then decrement the temperature (the initial, final, and decrement values provided)

 
Take Current State
